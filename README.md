# BinomialCoeff-Java
This ﬁle implements Binomial coefficients, where the ﬁrst input is n and the second input is k. This program implements a recursive algorithm in Java. The Recursive formula can be found at : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient
. This calculates C(n,k). Basically, how many ways can k be chosen from n?
